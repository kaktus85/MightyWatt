Program and calibration sketches
- The three program sketches are identical except for approximate calibration values for current ranges (4, 10 and 20 amps). These are only for initial testing. Calibrate your MightyWatt with the specific Arduino (or other ADC) you are using.
- The calibration sketch is needed for, you guessed it, calibration.
